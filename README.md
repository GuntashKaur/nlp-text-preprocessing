🧠 NLP Text Preprocessing using NLTK and Python
-

This project demonstrates key Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using Python’s NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library.
It focuses on how raw text data can be cleaned, processed, and prepared for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

The notebook performs a complete text preprocessing pipeline on a real-world dataset — TripAdvisor Hotel Reviews — to transform unstructured text into meaningful, analyzable form.

⚙️ Operations Performed in the Notebook
-

The notebook demonstrates a structured approach to text preprocessing with several core NLP operations:

Operation	Description:

1️⃣ **Data Loading**	-> Loaded the dataset tripadvisor_hotel_reviews.csv using pandas.read_csv() and explored its structure with data.info().

2️⃣ **Text Cleaning (Regex)**	-> Cleaned raw text using regular expressions (re module) to remove punctuation, numbers, and special symbols.

3️⃣ **Tokenization** -> 	Used nltk.word_tokenize() to split text into individual words or tokens. This helps analyze each word separately.

4️⃣ **Stopword Removal** -> 	Removed common, less meaningful words (e.g., the, is, and) using nltk.corpus.stopwords.

5️⃣ **Stemming** -> 	Applied PorterStemmer to reduce words to their root forms (e.g., running → run, played → play).

6️⃣ **Lemmatization**	-> Used WordNetLemmatizer to convert words into their base dictionary forms (e.g., studies → study, better → good).

7️⃣ **N-grams** -> Generation	Created N-grams (bigrams, trigrams) using nltk.util.ngrams() to capture sequences of words that frequently occur together (e.g., "hotel room", "good service").

8️⃣ **Data Exploration** ->	Analyzed dataset patterns and structure using pandas and simple visualizations via matplotlib.
